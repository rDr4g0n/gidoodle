==========
You run it and then pick a place and then it makes a gif! Easy!

You'll need ffmpeg and uhh... linux?

TODO
------
* build/install
* test portability
* make garbage code into something slightly less garbage

* select window mode
* confirm/clear selections before beginning
* push config options up to user
    * scale
    * skip palette generation
    * choose out filename/path
* clean up messages
    * show final gif details (size, location, dimensions)
    * add progress spinner
* ensure ffmpeg is all up on
